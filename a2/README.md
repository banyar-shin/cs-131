# DataCollector - Bash Dataset Summarizer

## What this script does
This script downloads a ZIP dataset from the UCI ML Repository, extracts CSV files, and allows the user to select columns and summarizes all selected columns in a Markdown file called `summary.md`.

## How to use this command
First, make sure that the file is executable.
```bash
chmod +x datacollector.sh
```

Then, you can execute the file directly!
```bash
./datacollector.sh
```

## Demo
Here is an example run:
```
â”” $ ./datacollector.sh
Enter URL to CSV dataset zip:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/186/wine+quality.zip
